    "Zeke is a very positive person and encourages those around him,
    but he has not done well technically this year.  There are two areas in which Zeke has
    room for improvement.  First, when communicating verbally (and sometimes in writing),
    he has a tendency to use more words than are required.  This conversational style does
    put people at ease, which is valuable, but it often makes the meaning difficult to isolate,
    and can cause confusion.

    Second, when discussing new requirements with project managers, less of the information
    is retained by Zeke long-term than is expected.  This has a few negative consequences:
    1) time is spent developing features that are not useful and need to be re-run,
    2) bugs are introduced in the code and not caught because the tests lack the same information,
    and 3) clients are told that certain features are complete when they are inadequate.
    This communication limitation could be the fault of project management, but given that
    other developers appear to retain more information, this is worth discussing further."

    "Thus far, there have been two concerns over Yvonne's performance,
    and both have been discussed with her in internal meetings.  First, in some cases,
    Yvonne takes longer to complete tasks than would normally be expected.  This most
    commonly manifests during development on existing applications, but can sometimes occur
    during development on new projects, often during tasks shared with Andrew.  In order
    to accommodate for these preferences, Yvonne has been putting more time into fewer projects,
    which has gone well.

    Second, while in conversation, Yvonne has a tendency to interrupt, talk over others, and
    increase her volume when in disagreement.  In client meetings, she also can dwell on potential
    issues even if the client or other attendees have clearly ruled the issue out, and can sometimes
    get off topic."

    "Xavier is a huge asset to SciMed and is a pleasure to work with.  He
    quickly knocks out tasks assigned to him, implements code that rarely needs to be revisited,
    and is always willing to help others despite his heavy workload.  When Xavier leaves on
    vacation, everyone wishes he didn't have to go

    Last year, the only concerns with Xavier performance were around ownership.  In the past
    twelve months, he has successfully taken full ownership of both Acme and Bricks, Inc.
    Aside from some false starts with estimates on Acme, clients are happy with his work and
    responsiveness, which is everything that his managers could ask for."

    "Wanda has been an incredibly consistent and effective developer.  Clients
    are always satisfied with her work, developers are impressed with her productivity, and
    she's more than willing to help others even when she has a substantial workload of her own.
    She is a great asset to Awesome Company, and everyone enjoys working with her.  During the
    past year, she has largely been devoted to work with the Cement Company, and she is the
    perfect woman for the job.  We know that work on a single project can become monotonous,
    however, so over the next few months, we hope to spread some of the Cement Company work to
    others.  This will also allow Wanda to pair more with others and spread her effectiveness
    to other projects."

  def communication_positive
    "Keith does a good job always asking for immediate feedback to make sure he is doing his work
    tasks properly. Frank has an ability to effectively communicate change of plans to employees
    and keeps them at ease during turbulent periods. Hilda's project team always raves at her
    ability to encourage open communication among team members. Jim's team has vastly improved
    their overall performance over the last year due to his positive feedback."
  end

  def communication_negative
    "Jack needs to work on his communication skills this next year.
    Effective communication requires more than just giving information when asked, Jack also
    needs to be proactive when engaging his team as issues come up. Also, Jack needs to work
    on the tone of his communication so listeners feel comfortable conversing with him. Terry
    tends to keep important information from his team members that he needs to share for
    optimal team performance. Jim needs to work on his ability to receive feedback from his
    co-workers. Usually Jim tends to attack when given criticism that is constructive in nature."

  def cooperation_positive
    "Shirley has done an outstanding job this past year cooperating with
    her team members during a very difficult company merger. She has demonstrated an eagerness to
    work with other teams that were created to help with the transition and was an excellent example
    of how cooperation can produce great results. "

  def cooperation_negative
    "Larry is in need of working on his ability to cooperate with fellow
    co-workers. There have been several situations over the last year where Larry has not cooperated
    with his co-workers and resulted in a substantial loss in productivity for his work group."
  end

  def job_knowledge_positive
    "Sam displays his job knowledge on a consistent basis. George is very
    consistent in demonstrating his job specific knowledge and technical capacity. Sonny always
    keeps up with new industry trends and then applies them when she sees they are beneficial to
    her work. "
  end

  def job_knowledge_negative
    "Jan fails to show basic job specific skills for someone that has
    her seniority with the organization. Jan needs to quickly improve her job knowledge and mastery.
    Brian consistently does not produce acceptable work and should improve his work knowledge to
    improve his results. "
